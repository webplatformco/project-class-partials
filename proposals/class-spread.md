# Class Spread Syntax

> [!NOTE]
> This is a work in progress and not yet ready for review.

## Motivation

Today, the spread syntax can be used to compose an object from multiple other objects of the same or similar type.
We have it for iterables:

```js
const arr = [...arr1, ...arr2];
```

And for objects:

```js
const obj = { ...obj1, ...obj2 };
```

But we don't have it for classes.

This makes it hard to abstract class behavior out into separate modules,
even in scenarios where class definitions can be cooperatively developed.

It also makes it hard to generate class API surface dynamically, without going back to dealing with prototypes.

## Proposal

The spread syntax for classes could work like this:

```js
class A {
	foo() { console.log("foo"); }
	static bar = "bar";
}

class B {
	...A;
}

console.log(B.bar); // "bar"
(new B).foo(); // "foo"
```

The semantics are largely those of assignment.
Class fields and static initialization blocks aside, it would desugar to something like:

```js
const instanceDescriptors = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors(A.prototype);
for (const key in instanceDescriptors) {
	if (key === "constructor") continue;
	Object.defineProperty(B.prototype, key, instanceDescriptors[key]);
}
const staticDescriptors = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors(A);
for (const key in staticDescriptors) {
	if (["length", "name", "prototype"].includes(key)) continue;
	Object.defineProperty(B, key, staticDescriptors[key]);
}
```

And with [customizable public class fields](customizable-fields.md), those can also be copied via:

```js
B[Symbol.publicFields].push(...A[Symbol.publicFields]);
```

Unlike [subclass factories](../prior-art.md#subclass-factories-mixins), the spread operator would not affect the inheritance chain, it is essentially a macro for adding class members (both instance and static).

### What is added and what is not added?

What is added:
- All members, both instance and static,
- All fields, both public and static

With the following exceptions:
- Private fields are not added, otherwise that would trivially violate encapsulation.
- Only **own members** are added, not inherited ones. Authors can manually spread inherited members if they need to.

The following is TBD:
- Constructors
- Static initialization blocks
- Decorators
- Internal properties (e.g. `[[ Call ]]`). Likely handled on a case-by-case basis.

Class spread syntax is not a way to address all class partial use cases, it’s a low-level feature to make tightly coupled use cases easier to manage.
Authors should not be spreading objects whose structure they don't control, as it can lead to error conditions.

```js
class A {
	#foo = 1;
	get foo() { return this.#foo }
}
class B { ...A }

const b = new B();
console.log(b.foo);
// TypeError: Cannot read private member #foo from an object whose class did not declare it
```

### Differences from object spread syntax

The main difference from object spread syntax is that descriptors are preserved.
This means that accessors remain accessors, they are not copied like regular properties.

### What about `super`?

Ideally, `super` should resolve based on the new class hierarchy.
But given that `super` is lexically bound, that might be tricky.

That said, even given simple assignment semantics, it can still be useful for cases where the spread class shares some of the same inheritance chain:

```js
class A {
	foo() { return "A"; }
}
class Trait extends A {
	foo() { return super.foo() + " Trait"; }
}
class B extends A {
	foo() { return "B"; }
}
class C extends B {
	...Trait;
}

console.log(new C().foo()); // "A Trait"
```

In some ways, this is more predictable.

When the Trait needs to reference the host class's superclass dynamically, rather than its own superclass, that can still be done with a little more work:

```js
class Trait extends A {
	foo() {
		let thisSuper = Object.getPrototypeOf(this.constructor)?.prototype;
		return thisSuper.foo.call(this) + " Trait";
	}
}

class C extends B {
	...Trait;
}

console.log(new C().foo()); // "B Trait"
```

### Naming collisions

Just like other uses of spread syntax, the semantics would be essentially those of a macro: any naming collisions are resolved via a last-one-wins policy, as if they have been manually specified twice.
As such, shadowed fields are fully overwritten and are not recoverable.

### References

References are preserved, but there is no way to disentangle where a member is coming from with certainty.

I.e. in the earlier example, `B.prototype.foo === A.prototype.foo` is true, but it is not possible to know whether this is a result of the spread syntax or manual assignment.

### What can be spread?

Any class can be spread, including built-in ones (though that is unlikely to be very useful).

It may be useful to also allow regular objects to be spread, to facilitate better code sharing between different API paradigms (e.g. OOP and module-based).

```js
import * as functions from "./functions.js";

class Color {
	...functions;
}
```

This would also allow for dynamically generating API surface (e.g. for controllers):

```js
class MyClass {
	foo = new FooController(this);

	static fooProps = []
	...Object.fromEntries(this.constructor.fooProps.map(property => [
		property,
		function(...args) {
			return this.foo[property](...args);
		},
	]))
}
```

Ideally, it should be possible to specify both instance and static members that way.

Perhaps spread syntax within static initialization blocks could be special cased to support this:

```js
import { instanceFooProps, staticFooProps } from "./foo.js";

class MyClass {
	...instanceFooProps;
	static {
		...staticFooProps;
	}
}
```

Alternatively, to support both "classes" defined via prototypal inheritance directly, it could copy top-level fields as static and prototype fields as instance:

```js
let obj = {
	foo: 2,
	prototype: {
		foo () { return 1 }
	}
}
class MyClass {
	...obj;
}

console.log(MyClass.foo); // 2
console.log(new MyClass().foo()); // 1
```

This also has the very desirable trait (no pun intended 😅) that traits can be applied with a single line of code even when defined procedurally (which is useful for modules).
